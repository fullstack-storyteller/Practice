# Web API authentication using Google Authentication

Project Code in Login.HTML in 3_WebApiTokenAuthenticationUsingOwin

Google authentication and facebook authentication allows a way to authenticate users to log into our system or app. To do that we must register our app with google, facebook or any other intended authentication providers.

Benefits of using social login:

- It becomes easy for user to access the application with their existing social media account
- We don't have to provide the security specific implementation for login of the user. It is handled by the login/authentication providers itself.
- Users don't need to remember the password for the app separately.

The authentication or login provider details will get saved in ASPNETUSERS and ASPNETUSERLOGINS tables in the Identity database of the app we created in this projects.
