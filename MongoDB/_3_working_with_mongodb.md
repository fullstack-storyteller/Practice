# Working with MongoDB

## MongoDB Compass App

We can use the MongoDB Compass GUI application to work with MongoDB. The application is fairly self explanatory when you open it.

## MongoDB extension in VS Code

It is kind of the preferred way to work in MongoDB. Once installing the extension, open a new terminal and go to the following location `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin` in command prompt.

After that you can run the command `mongo.exe` -> this will open the mongodb shell.
